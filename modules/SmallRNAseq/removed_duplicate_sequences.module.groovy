         (i) convert FastQ to tabular (comma separated) format and filter exact duplicates (NNNN-insert-NNNN) which are most likely PCR clones NOTE: FastQ-Sanger quality scores may have "," for Phred=11 in the raw FastQ files; however the "highQ" files don't contain "," which can be used as a field separator.
         (ii) convert the filtered data back to FastQ format. NOTE: the random barcodes are still present, will be removed during mapping.""",
